1. What is the difference in recyclerView and listView?
List View is the original container view for android. It frontend loads all of its objects which makes
it somewhat cumbersome. This is called Eager Loading. It can only do vertical scrolling by default, and
on upside is that the Listeners don't have to be manually put in.
Recycle view uses lazy loading, where it only loads what it needs or thinks it will be using, saving loading times
and memory.It's much newer and being adapted by more companies.

2. Define lazy loading.
Lazy initialization is used by vals only. Lazy initialization requires that the initialization code is
supplied, but not defined. It will initialize the val when its needed, and after that it can't be changed.

3. What is an item decorator in RecyclerViews?
An item decorater is a fancy graphic that gets rendered in with each item, like a divider. It can be used
to provide more visual feedback and clarity.


4. What is the View Holder Pattern?
The ViewHolder design pattern allows you to access items without constantly needing to look them up, avoiding
multiple findViewById() calls which can be memory intensive.,

5. How do you implement a item touch helper for the RecyclerView?
You need to create two interfaces, one that is an adapter.
Then you need a callback as well. This will allow you to react to user input.
You also need to override a few methods that control movement.
